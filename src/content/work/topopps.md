TopOPPS was a SaaS startup that plugged into CRMs like Salesforce and offered sales forecasting and an easier-to-use interface for updating Opportunities. I worked on the backend in Python and Django, the frontend in Javascript, and the database in PostgreSQL. I also helped with the sales process, assisting with demos and prioritizing key features to close deals. I mentored two interns who became full-time contributing team members. I also rearchitected the code to support CRMs other than Salesforce, increasing our market by hundreds of thousands of companies.
