Tired of needing to come up with synonyms for 'Therefore,' in your mathematical writing? Ponder no longer! This LaTeX package provides a macro to carefully select one of a multitude of choices.

This project was inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1gov71/mathematical_writing_synonyms_for_therefore/), particularly

```
lucasvb: Someone should collect these into a macro.
    perpetual_motion: We need a command that would just insert one at random.
```

import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import latexTherefore from "./latex-therefore-sqrt-2.png";

<figure>
  <Image src={latexTherefore} alt="Proof that √2 is irrational" />
  <figcaption>As an example, here is a proof that √2 is irrational</figcaption>
</figure>

Using the package is easy. Download the file [therefore.sty](https://raw.github.com/bgschiller/latex-therefore/master/therefore.sty). In the preamble of your LaTeX document, enter

```latex
\usepackage{therefore}
```

Wherever you would otherwise laboriously choose a synonym for 'Therefore', simply type

```latex
\Therefore there are an infinite number of primes.
```
