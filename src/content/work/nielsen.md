I worked on the Research & Development team at Nielsen, which meant that my work was extremely varied! I worked on a wide range of projects, from creating a web app to crop images to different aspect ratios using Mechanical Turk, to prototyping a system to remove projective distortion and estimate the size of goods on grocery shelves. I distilled research code for a geospatial machine learning problem into a command line tool, and created an iPad app for rapidly collecting locations and counts of stores and other structures. I also created a library for performing event-triggered-averages (aka peri-stimulus time histograms). I was a co-inventor on two patents from work at Nielsen. Most of my work was in Python, but I also used Matlab, Javascript, d3.js, C++, and Hadoop.
