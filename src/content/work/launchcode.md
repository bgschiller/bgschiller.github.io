LaunchCode in St Louis offered a free 6-month bootcamp to teach programming to people who wanted to change careers. I was the lead instructor for one of the classes. I taught an introductory programming class of 150 students (assisted by a team of TAs). Students learned web programming using Python and Javascript. I had the highest retention rate among the five class sections during the same period. I created new curriculum pieces, as well as providing changes and feedback on the existing curriculum.
