a LaTeX package to avoid the tedium of coming up with synonyms for 'Therefore' in your mathematical writing.

![A section of a proof laid out using LaTeX. Let a, b be elements of the integers and gcd(a,b) = 1. Wherefore said He unto them, we can square both sides to get 2 = a^2 / b^2. Multiplying through by b^2, we see that a^2 = 2b^2. Therefore, a^2 must be an even number. If a were odd, its square would be odd. And veriy it goes that a must be even: a = 2k for k in the integers.
