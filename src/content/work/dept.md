At Devetry, and then DEPT, I lead teams working on client's software projects. Sometimes that meant taking over a project that was in trouble, sometimes it meant starting a project from scratch. I was responsible for the technical direction of the project, the quality of the code, and the happiness of the team. I also worked with the sales team to help scope out and estimate new projects and with the client to make sure we were delivering what they needed.

While I was at Devetry it grew from about 9 people to about 40, and then was acquired by DEPT. I helped shape the culture to be one of learning and growth by starting an engineering book club, presenting lunch and learns and coaching coworkers to present their own topics, and making it a priority to help more junior teammates.
